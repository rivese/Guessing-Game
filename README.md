Guessing-Game
=============

In this simple game, a user guesses animals based off of their descriptions. The user can choose to guess either real or imaginary animals. When guessing real animals, typically a single word is given to the user, and an additional word is given with each subsequent wrong guess. When guessing imaginary animals, a short description is provided and the user has three chances to guess correctly.
